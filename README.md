# 💫 About Me:
🔒 Hi, I’m Shubham, a passionate cybersecurity professional. I currently work as an IT Support Technician, where I focus on security, cloud technologies, and providing technical support to ensure smooth system operations. My career journey has led me through hands-on experiences with digital forensics and incident response, penetration testing, and securing cloud environments.

I hold a strong academic background with my Master’s in Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland - College Park, with certifications like CEH, eJPT, and CCSP-AWS. I’m always keen to learn and grow, constantly diving into new areas like incident response, SIEM techniques, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC).

My skillset spans a range of security practices including vulnerability assessment, threat intelligence, cloud security, digital forensics, and penetration testing. I’m proficient in tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, Kali Linux, and AWS, with a strong foundation in incident handling and threat mitigation strategies.

I’m looking to connect with like-minded professionals and collaborate on cybersecurity research and hands-on projects. I’m also exploring opportunities to expand my network within the cybersecurity field and develop innovative automation solutions for security operations.
